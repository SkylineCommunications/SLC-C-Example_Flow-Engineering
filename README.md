# Flow Engineering Connector Example

Example DataMiner connector that demonstrates how to support generic flow engineering (FLE) tables via InterApp messages.

The objective is to create a mediation layer using generic tables. 
This allows to track which incoming and outgoing flows are passing through an element in a standardized way.
The tables are mostly populated with data that is coming from the device, but also extended with metadata from flow engineering itself.
Flows can be multicast streams, SDI or ASI connections, and more.
These tables are used by the MediaOps solution to show the **as-is** path, which represents the actual route a specific signal takes through the devices.

## Implementation
### Protocol.xml

 - Copy tables 9991000, 9991100, 9991200 and 9991300
 - Copy relations
 - Copy QAction 9991000 (including code)

### Skyline.DataMiner.FlowEngineering.Protocol namespace

The `Skyline.DataMiner.FlowEngineering.Protocol` namespace contains useful classes and methods that assist developers to fill in the FLE tables in an object oriented way.

[Link to code](QAction_1/Skyline/DataMiner/FlowEngineering/Protocol)

To get access to the main 'manager' object call the `FlowEngineeringManager.GetInstance(protocol)` method. The resulting object is the main entry point of the helper classes.
```csharp
var flowEngineering = FlowEngineeringManager.GetInstance(protocol);
```

Use properties and lists to add/update/remove data in the object structure:
```csharp
flowEngineering.Interfaces.Add(new Interface("...") { ... });
flowEngineering.Interfaces["10"].AdminStatus = InterfaceAdminStatus.Up;

flowEngineering.IncomingFlows.Add(new RxFlow("...") { ... });
flowEngineering.OutgoingFlows.Add(new TxFlow("...") { ... });
...
```

After adapting properties in the objects, the tables can be updates using the following methods:
```csharp
flowEngineering.Interfaces.UpdateTable(protocol);
flowEngineering.IncomingFlows.UpdateTable(protocol);
flowEngineering.OutgoingFlows.UpdateTable(protocol);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Data is being cached in the SLScripting process. To ensure that all old data is cleared, it's recommended to call `FlowEngineeringManagerInstances.CreateNewInstance(protocol)` after startup.

### FLE Interfaces table
The `FLE Interfaces Overview Table` lists all interfaces that are eligible for flow engineering.

Example code:
```csharp
var flowEngineering = FlowEngineeringManager.GetInstance(protocol);
var dcfInterfaceHelper = DcfInterfaceHelper.Create(protocol);
var newInterfaces = new List<Interface>();

foreach (var ifConfig in interfacesConfig)
{
	var ifIndex = Convert.ToString(ifConfig.InterfaceNumber);

	if (!flowEngineering.Interfaces.TryGetValue(ifIndex, out var intf))
		intf = new Interface(ifIndex);

	intf.Description = $"Ethernet{ifIndex}";
	intf.DisplayKey = $"Ethernet{ifIndex}";
	intf.Type = InterfaceType.Ethernet;
	intf.AdminStatus = InterfaceAdminStatus.Down;
	intf.OperationalStatus = InterfaceOperationalStatus.Down;
	intf.DcfInterfaceId = dcfInterfaceHelper.TryFindInterface(1, ifIndex, out var dcfIntf) ? dcfIntf.ID : -1;

	newInterfaces.Add(intf);
}

flowEngineering.Interfaces.ReplaceInterfaces(newInterfaces);
flowEngineering.Interfaces.UpdateTable(protocol);
```

> [!NOTE]
> Some columns are automatically calculated and don't need to be filled in:
>  - Rx/Tx Flows
>  - Rx/Tx Expected Flows
>  - Rx/Tx Expected Bitrate

The `DCF Interface ID` column is important in order to be able to follow the as-is path. To obtain the the DCF interface ID based on `parameter group` and `index`, the following helper method can be used.
It's advised to cache the `dcfInterfaceHelper` variable when being called multiple times in a loop.

```csharp
var dcfInterfaceHelper = DcfInterfaceHelper.Create(protocol);
dcfInterfaceHelper.TryFindInterface(1 /* parameter group */, interfaceIndex, out var dcfIntf);
var dcfInterfaceID = dcfIntf.ID;
```

### Incoming and Outgoing Flows table
These tables contains information about incoming and outgoing flows on the device.

 - information about the signal itself (transport type, IP address, port, ...)
 - incoming/outgoing interface
 - expected bitrate and comparison with actual bitrate
 - indication if the signal is present or not
 - ownership (local system or flow engineering)
 - foreign keys which link incoming and outgoing flows
 - ...

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The content of the rows in the flow tables should primarily originate from information retrieved from the device. This is crucial because the main objective is to accurately track the **as-is** path of flows.

Add as minimum:
 - IP
	- Transport Type
	- Destination IP
	- Destination Port (when available)
	- Source IP
	- Interface
 - SDI/ASI
	- Transport Type
	- Interface

Where possible also add FKs:
 - From incoming flow to outgoing flows (1-1 or 1-N relation)
 - From outgoing flow to incoming flows (N-1 relation)

Also see [example connections](#example-connections).

Example code:
```csharp
var flowEngineering = FlowEngineeringManager.GetInstance(protocol);
var newFlows = new List<Flow>();

// handle current flows
foreach (var mrnh in multicastRouteNextHops)
{
	var instance = String.Join("/", mrnh.SourceAddress, mrnh.GroupAddress, mrnh.InterfaceIndex);

	if (!flowEngineering.OutgoingFlows.TryGetValue(instance, out var flow))
	{
		// new flow
		flow = new TxFlow(instance)
		{
			TransportType = FlowTransportType.IP,
			FlowOwner = FlowOwner.LocalSystem,
			Label = mrnh.Label,
			DestinationIP = mrnh.GroupAddress,
			DestinationPort = -1,
			SourceIP = mrnh.SourceAddress,
			Interface = mrnh.InterfaceIndex,
			ForeignKeyIncoming = String.Join("/", mrnh.GroupAddress, mrnh.SourceAddress),
		};

		flowEngineering.OutgoingFlows.Add(flow);
	}

	flow.Bitrate = mrnh.BitrateActual;
	flow.IsPresent = true;

	newFlows.Add(flow);
}

// handle old flows
foreach (var flow in flowEngineering.OutgoingFlows.Values.Except(existingFlows).ToList())
{
	if (flow.FlowOwner == FlowOwner.FlowEngineering)
		flow.IsPresent = false;
	else
		flowEngineering.OutgoingFlows.Remove(flow.Instance);
}

// update tables
flowEngineering.UpdateInterfaceAndOutgoingFlowsTables(protocol);
```

### Process InterApp messages
#### FlowInfoMessage
The `FlowInfoMessage` is being used to update the flow IDs and owner in the flow tables and to configure the device. The other data in these tables should be based on data that was retrieved from the device through polling. Flow configuration data should not go immediately from the interapp message into the tables (in most cases). This is important because it could be that the device did not get configured correctly (same principle as when doing a set on the device).

See [QAction 9000000](QAction_9000000/QAction_9000000.cs)

```csharp
var flowEngineering = FlowEngineeringManager.GetInstance(protocol);

switch (Message.ActionType)
{
	case ActionType.Create:
		var flowInstance = Message.OptionalDestinationIdentifier;
		var addedFlows = flowEngineering.RegisterFlowEngineeringFlowsFromInterAppMessage(protocol, Message, flowInstance);

		break;

	case ActionType.Delete:
		var removedFlows = flowEngineering.UnregisterFlowEngineeringFlowsFromInterAppMessage(protocol, Message);

		break;

	default:
		throw new InvalidOperationException($"Unknown action: {Message.ActionType}");
}
```
